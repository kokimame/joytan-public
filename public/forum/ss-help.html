        Our service <b>does not</b> store any image on our server. 
        We use a img-src link to the image at the proprietor's Web page.
        Displaying an image (without permissions) by linking to them does
         not violate the provisions of the copyright law
          prohibiting unauthorized reproduction and distribution of copies of a work.
          Because we do not store the photographic images, we do not have a copy of
           the images for purposes of the Copyright Act.
      </p>
      <p>
        If you are an owner of images linked from our service and want us to take down the links,
        please send us an email (JoytanApp [at] gmail.com) with a link to your content.
      </p>

        Currently, Gallery has to be navigated manually. In the future, we make an auto navigation
        function so that images in Gallery are automatically updated correspondingly with the video played above.
