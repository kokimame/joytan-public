        <b>Joytan Public</b> is a place where we review user-generated voice recordings from Joytan-REC.
        Currently, there are only three criteria but we will increase
        them to give a more detailed description to each recordins and make interesting language-teaching
        video, for example, a video which only features with deep voice or anime-like high tone voice.
      </p>
      <p>
        For the current three evaluation criteria, please choose
        <ul>
          <li><b>"<i class="fa fa-thumbs-up"></i>"</b> if you think pronunciation is clear enough for language learners</li>
          <li><b>"Wrong"</b> if you find an audio content does not match with its script</li>
          <li><b>"Unclear"</b> if you perceive too much noise in an audio content</li>
        </ul>
      </p>
      <p>
        The <b>live progress bar</b> below shows how much progress are made for each project.
        It counts the number by an entry (not an individual recordings).
        <p>

          </div>
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li><b>"Available</b> shows how many entries are recorded and available on this site.</li>
          <li><b>"Reviewed"</b> means the number of entries which are reviewed by any user.</li>
          <li><b>"Finalized"</b> shows how many entries are decided to be used in production by admin. 
          These entries will be less accessible on Joytan-REC in order to reduce duplication</li>

        Joytan-REC aims to collect pronunciations (a single word to a short sentence)
          from the crowd of language enthusiasts and make use of such voice recordings 
          to develop free and fun language learning services. 
      </p>
      <p>
        For instance, the voice recording you send through this app will be used in
          our YouTube channel (Joytan App) and an even more open platform where everyone 
          can freely download and use for educational purpose.
      </p>
      <p>
      For now, your benefits of contributing this project are a bumper ad/promo 
      (like your name, social account) or a short promotional movie at the beginning 
      of our YouTube video in which your voice recordings are used.
        And of course, you will see more free and fun language learning videos from us 
        because your contribution will grow our channel and attract other contributors.
