        Joytan-REC aims to collect pronunciations (a single word to a short sentence)
          from the crowd of language enthusiasts and make use of such voice recordings 
          to develop free and fun language learning services. 
      </p>
      <p>
        For instance, the voice recording you send through this app will be used in
          our YouTube channel (Joytan App) and an even more open platform where everyone 
          can freely download and use for educational purpose.
      </p>
      <p>
      For now, your benefits of contributing this project are a bumper ad/promo 
      (like your name, social account) or a short promotional movie at the beginning 
      of our YouTube video in which your voice recordings are used.
        And of course, you will see more free and fun language learning videos from us 
        because your contribution will grow our channel and attract other contributors.
